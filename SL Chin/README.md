## Weekly Progress Log (2025-08-18)

**Study Time**: 24 hours  
**Material Covered**: Kaggle course - [Intro to Programming, Python], All Lesson

**What I Learned**:
- [Different type of data: string, boolean, float, integer]
- [Define function + conditional statement]
- [How to use list function to organize data: index, remove, add, slice, length, min, max, sum]

**Challenges Faced**:
- [The questions for Week 1 is too advanced for me as a beginner, especially the Python course.]
- [Define function is very challenging to understand, especially `return()` and add on with conditional statement.]
- [When solving question, I am not sure how to start the first step. I can only study from the solution.]

**Next Steps**:
- [Re-learn again eventhough the course is completed (My basic understanding is still weak).]

**Questions / Help Needed**:
- [So far, I need to help myself first by studying more.]
- [All the question I have now is because of unfamiliar with coding language.]
