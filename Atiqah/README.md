## Weekly Progress Log (2025-08-18)

**Study Time**: 10 hours  
**Material Covered**: Kaggle course - [Hello, Phyton], Lesson 4, 5 and 6.
**What I Learned**:
- I learned indexing, slicing, changing the list.
- how to call a function such as len, sorted, sum, max, min
- differences between list and tuple
- difference between for loop and while loop
- string and string method
  
**Challenges Faced**:
- there are a lot built-in method and function that i don't know when to apply in the code
- the exercise is too challenging for me as a beginner

**Next Steps**:
- To restudy the whole lesson to improve my undertanding

**Questions / Help Needed**:
- Is there any trick or tips that can make me know when to apply certain function or method


## Weekly Progress Log (2025-08-17)

**Study Time**: 5 hours  
**Material Covered**: Kaggle course - [Hello, Phyton], Lesson 1, 2 and 3 (Hello, Phyton, Function and getting Help, and Booleans and conditions)

**What I Learned**:
- Operation in Phyton always follows PEMDAS rules, hence it is important to set parenthese correctly
- need to understand how the built in function work
- help function explain what other function does.
- A colon symbol indicate the block of code start there and all the indented line belong to it.
  
**Challenges Faced**:
- Not familiar with the terms
- Still confuse about the bracket type.
- The tutorial given is more simple and straightforward but the exercise is more complex and confusing for beginner like me

**Next Steps**:
- Move on to next Lesson.

**Questions / Help Needed**:
- I need to understand all the terms, functions, and symbol.

## Weekly Progress Log (2025-08-16)

**Study Time**: 3 hours  
**Material Covered**: Kaggle course - [Intro to Programming], Lesson 4 and 5 (Condition, conditional statement and Intro to list)

**What I Learned**:
- Conditional statement is where you set the rule and the program follows the rule.
- it is important to undertand the operational symbol to construct condition
- As compared to string, list can store any type of data (text, numbers, boolean)
- unlike a string, list can be update by remove or append function.
- it is important to understand when to use the correct type of brackets
  
**Challenges Faced**:
- got "Syntaxerror" due to keep forgetting colon symbol
- confuse when to use the correct types of brackets

**Next Steps**:
- Move on to Lesson 4 and 5: Condition, conditional statement and Intro to list

**Questions / Help Needed**:
- How to determine when to use squared brackets?

## Weekly Progress Log (2025-08-15)

**Study Time**: 2 hours  
**Material Covered**: Kaggle course - [Intro to Programming], Lesson 3 (Data Types)  
**What I Learned**:
- So far, I learn few data types in this chapter such as string, boolean, integer, and float
- boolean can be switch by adding symbol "not" in the equation.
- it is important to put quotation mark when write a text

**Challenges Faced**:
- 

**Next Steps**:
- - Move on to Lesson 4 and 5: Condition, conditional statement and Intro to list

**Questions / Help Needed**:
- 
  
## Weekly Progress Log (2025-08-14)

**Study Time**: 3 hours  
**Material Covered**: Kaggle course - [Intro to Programming], Lesson 1 and 2 (Arithmetic, Varible and Function)  
**What I Learned**:
- Phyton is case-sensitive a for built in function.
- Arithmetic is a direct math equation in Phyton.
- it is important to understand Phyton math operation symbol as it a bit different that normal math operation.
- Variables is a code text that stored value that can be use in the equation.
- In phyton, variable is reusable and updatable
- And Function is a code that takes the input and give output

**Challenges Faced**:
- Tend to forgot to put block.
- Always get a `NameError` due to typo when writing variables.

**Next Steps**:
- To read more code examples
- Move on to Lesson 3: Data Types

**Questions / Help Needed**:
- I'm not fully understand how function arguments work, I'm able to edit the function in the exercise because it already given.
- Any useful tips?

- ## Weekly Progress Log (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Study Time**: X hours  
**Material Covered**: Kaggle course - [Course Name], Lesson X
