# data-science-training-2025
## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository is for non-engineer team members to build practical data science skills using free Kaggle courses.  
The goal is to complete a 4-week training program and apply the knowledge to a mini project by the end of Week 4.

## ðŸ’¬ Communication

Weâ€™ve created a Microsoft Teams group for this training program.  
Feel free to use it to:
- Share your progress or mini project updates  
- Ask questions or get help  
- Exchange tips and ideas with others  

Letâ€™s keep the conversation active and supportive!

## ðŸ“š How to Participate & Learning Flow

This is a self-paced program using Kaggle and GitHub.

1. Work through the Kaggle courses at your own pace.
2. After completing a course or lesson, upload your Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) to your folder in this repository.
3. At the end of each week, write a short progress memo in your `yourname/README.md` file to reflect on your learning.
4. If you have questions or run into issues, use the **Teams group** to ask for help or share tips.
5. Collaborate, support each other, and enjoy the learning process!

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal (Week 4)

By the end of Week 4, each participant will complete a **mini data project** using real-world datasets.  
The project should demonstrate the ability to:
- Load and clean data using Pandas
- Visualize key insights
- Apply basic feature engineering
- Communicate findings clearly in a Jupyter Notebook

You can choose a dataset from Kaggle or use one provided in the repository.  
The final notebook should be uploaded to your folder and will be reviewed during the final session.

## ðŸ§  Tips for Success

- Set aside regular time each week to study.
- Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t understand everything at firstâ€”ask questions!
- Focus on applying what you learn in your own mini project.
- Collaborate and share insights with others.
