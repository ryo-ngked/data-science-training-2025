# data-science-training-2025
## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository is for non-engineer team members to build practical data science skills using free Kaggle courses.  
The goal is to complete a 4-week training program and apply the knowledge to a mini project by the end of Week 4.

## ðŸ‘¥ How to Participate

1. work directly on GitHub.
2. Go to your folder under `/your_name/`.
3. Use the provided progress memo template(/yourname/README.md) to track your learning.
4. Upload your notebooks under `yourname/`.
5. Update your progress at least once a week.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal (Week 4)

By the end of Week 4, each participant will complete a **mini data project** using real-world datasets.  
The project should demonstrate the ability to:
- Load and clean data using Pandas
- Visualize key insights
- Apply basic feature engineering
- Communicate findings clearly in a Jupyter Notebook

You can choose a dataset from Kaggle or use one provided in the repository.  
The final notebook should be uploaded to your folder and will be reviewed during the final session.

## ðŸ§  Tips for Success

- Set aside regular time each week to study.
- Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t understand everything at firstâ€”ask questions!
- Focus on applying what you learn in your own mini project.
- Collaborate and share insights with others.
